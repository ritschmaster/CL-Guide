The purpose of this library is to demonstrate the modern use of Common
Lisp for production code. This project itself is of course not meant
for production!

* Features
- A lot of demonstration source code:
  - CLOS
  - Generic methods
  - Macros
- ASDF
- Package Management
- Quicklisp
- Unit testing
* Quicklisp
First you have to set up Quicklisp ([[http://www.quicklisp.org]]).  The
project skeleton for this project was generated with the following
command in SBCL (can be any other ANSI Common Lisp implementation of
course):
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(ql:quickload 'quickproject)
(quickproject:make-project #P"~/quicklisp/local-projects/SchoolManagement"
:name "SchoolManagement"
:depends-on '(lisp-unit2))
#+END_SRC
