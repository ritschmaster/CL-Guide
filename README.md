CL-Guide
========

A small Guide to Common Lisp for new and old Lispers.

# Credits
This guide is an abstract of the book "Practical Common Lisp" written
by Peter Seibel. All rights are reserved. The "[]" marks below to the
headings are references to chapters of the book from which the
information has been taken.

Additionally many quite helpful things which are not described in
Peter Seibel's book are complemented with describing external
libraries.

This document has been written by Richard BÃ¤ck and is happily shared
for all new and old Lispers.
