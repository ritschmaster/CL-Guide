# CL-Guide
A small Guide to Common Lisp for new and old Lispers.

## Credits
This guide is at its core an abstract of the book "Practical Common
Lisp" written by Peter Seibel. Therefore it is recommended (if you are
new) that you read it in the first place. This document should serve
as a quick-look-up for the things you have already learned (altough
you could learn from it too).

Additionally many quite helpful things which are not described in
Peter Seibel's book are complemented with describing external
libraries.

## Application examples
This guide features also a Common Lisp application. This should help
jumping in full Lisp action instantly. Furthermore it should give some
ideas on how you can structure and organize your code.
